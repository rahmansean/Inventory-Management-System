# Inventory-Management-System
A distributed inventory management system employs a distributed database setup, distributing data across multiple sites. Oracle Database and PL/SQL Procedure Language are used in this project.

Description:
This system has two sites. One of them is the main site that is site1 and another is site2. Main
site can insert on its own site and also on site2. It can delete, update on its own database and
also perform deletion operation on site2. On the other hand, site2 can insert only on its own
database.
